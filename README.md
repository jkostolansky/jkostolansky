# Hi, I'm Juraj KostolanskÃ½ ðŸ‘‹

I'm based in Slovakia working remotely (mostly) as a **Ruby on Rails web developer**,
or making side projects, such as [LocaleData](https://www.localedata.com/). You can find more
about me on my personal website [www.kostolansky.sk](https://www.kostolansky.sk/).

Do you want to hire me? Need any help? Or just want to get in touch and say hello?
I love hearing from people, so please email me at [juraj@kostolansky.sk](mailto:juraj@kostolansky.sk)
or follow me on Twitter [@jkostolansky](https://twitter.com/jkostolansky).
